# COROLLARY
Various resources on visual art.

This repo is intended to compile together resources that are understandable to someone as mal-inclined towards the arts as I am. Most resources are picked as those that contain very little vague explanation (e.g. "energy" "rhythm" that kind of bull without any further elaboration besides something like "practice") but rather provide understanding beyond the scope of the provided data.

# MOTIVATION

- This repo distributes resources for free. If you claim (in response to the AI uprising) that art isn't a gatekept pursuit then I can assume you will have no problems with this repo existing.
